Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
making it over 2000 years old.
Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
College in Virginia, looked up one of demore obscure
Latin words, consectetur,
from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
and going through decites of deword in classical literature, 
discovered deundoubtable source.
Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus 
Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 
45 BC.
This book is a treatise on detheory of ethics, very popular during de
Renaissance.
The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from 
a line in section 1.10.32.
